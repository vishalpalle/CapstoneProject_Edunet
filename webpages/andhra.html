            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/Borra caves.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Located on the east coast of India, the Borra Caves are situated in the Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valley in Visakhapatnam district. Breath taking hilly terrain, beautiful landscape, semi-evergreen moist deciduous forests, and wild fauna of the Borra Caves are a visual feast.A marvellous creation of nature, the Borra caves were formed when river waters flow through a limestone area, and the calcium carbonate turns into calcium bicarbonate, which
                is easily washed out by the running water.
