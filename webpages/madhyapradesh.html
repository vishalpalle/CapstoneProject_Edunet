            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/patalpani-waterfall.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>The Patalpani Waterfall is located in the Mhow Tehsil of Indore district and is a popular picnic spot for the locals of the area. Surrounded by dense forest covers and majestic hills Patalpani plummets from a height of 300 metres. The monsoons swell the falls and may make it risky for close encounters causing accidents. It is best to maintain a cautious distance from the waterfall during the rain.
