            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/diu-fort.jpg" alt="" ></div>
            <p>
                Dating back to 1535 when Portuguese thought of staying India, they built this marvel. Standing still and portraying the greatness of Portugal rulers, this fort bathes in sunlight and glows in the moonlight and stays beside the enormous Arabian Sea each day. The existence of a huge lighthouse beside the fort adds another dimension to the panoramic view of the surrounding.

            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/st-paul-church.jpg" alt="" ></div>
            <p>One of the best Baroque architectural examples prevails here in this church. Being named after St. Paul, the Apostle of Jesus, this church still continues to function and dates to 1601 AD. It is dedicated to Our Lady of Immaculate Conception and its structure is similar to the famous Bom Jesus Basilica which is in Goa.

            <h1>Naida Caves</h1>
            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/Naida-Caves.jpg" alt="" ></div>
            <p> The history of this cave is still a mystery but few say that when the Portuguese wanted to build the Diu fort, so they broke down huge rocks and this is why these caves have such a formation. Being constructed near the Diu fort, this is the best place to visit in morning to see how the sunlight enters this cave. It is worth a treasure for explorers and a treat for photographers.
