            <p> Chitrakote Falls inevitably finds its way to the top. This waterfall is located around 50km away from Jagdalpur of Bastar District. Also known as the mini-Niagara Fall of India, this horse-shaped waterfall makes it’s descend from a height of almost 100ft. Making its way through dense vegetation and cascades, it creates a spectacular sight. The roar of the waterfall reverberate through the surrounding areas, while the mist lingering at the base lends it an artistic view.
