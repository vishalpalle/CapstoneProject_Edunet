            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/butterfly-beach.jpg" alt="" ></div>
            <p>Butterfly Beach is located in the Canacona district of Goa, a bit to the south of Palolem. Among the most romantic places to visit in Goa, it is often called Honeymoon Beach. The beach is in the shape of a little cove that is bordered by tall vegetation. It is one of the lesser-known beaches in the state.               The only way to get to Butterfly Beach is via land, and getting there requires a strenuous journey through a forest.
