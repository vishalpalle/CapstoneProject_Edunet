            <p>One of the four most sacred Char Dham Hindu pilgrimage sites and seven most ancient Sapta Puri religious cities in India, Dwarka is considered to be the ancient kingdom of Lord Krishna and the first capital of Gujarat. The Krishna Janmashtami festival is a major event there. Of special importance is Dwarkadhish Temple, built approximately 200 BC and often referred to as Jagat Mandir.

            <p> If you're interested in Indo-Islamic architecture, you'll marvel over the splendid design of the striking 19 century Mahabat Maqbara mausoleum complex of local rulers at Junagadh. This historical city, whose name means Old Fort, is situated at the bottom of the sacred and temple-covered Girnar Hills. On the way to the hills is a building housing 14 rock-carved edicts of Emperor Ashoka, dating back to 250 BC.

            <div class="card-image"><img src="../Images/Rani-ki-Vav.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Rani ki Vav is an ancient abandoned stepwell dating back to the 11th century and UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was also constructed during the Solanki dynasty, apparently in memory of ruler Bhimdev I, by his widowed wife. The stepwell has stairs going down seven levels, and panels containing more than 500 main sculptures and over 1,000 minor ones. Only discovered relatively recently, the stepwell was flooded by the nearby Saraswati River and silted over until the late 1980s.  </p>

            <p> The world's tallest statue, dedicated to Indian independence activist Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel (1875â€“1950), was completed in 2018. At 182 meters tall, it's twice the size of the Statue of Liberty. Patel was the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India, and is highly regarded for his leadership in bringing the 562 princely states of India together.</p>
